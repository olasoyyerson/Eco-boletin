            <h1>Causes of man-made deforestation</h1>
            <p>Human activities are the main cause of deforestation and, also, it is the most serious cause as it is avoidable. Among the main causes of deforestation produced by humans are:</p>

    <h1>1.Why nodownt cut  trees?</h1>
    <ul>


<li>Trees are an incredible natural technology. Often called the lungs of the planet, living trees in tropical forests “inhale” carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air. Healthy forests clean the air and regulate the climate.</li>
<li>Living forests sustain life: they benefit people, plants and animals for all the invisible work they do as a carbon store. They also help control the planet's climate and rainfall.</li>
<li>Planting trees in damaged or cleared forests creates a crop of carbon-eating saplings. As the trees grow – over 50 to 100 years – they absorb CO2 from the air and, in turn, restore a home for birds and wildlife.</li>

<h1>2. Consequences of deforestation</h1>

    </ul>
    <li> Now that we have discussed what causes tree loss, let's talk about the consequences of deforestation that can be more or less serious and, in some situations, can be dire.</li>
        <li><strong> Of the water cycle</strong>
            Trees attract rain and forests are a vital part of the water cycle. For this reason, when losing forest masses, the behavior of water in the area is modified, since it moves towards other parts with vegetation.</li>
           <li><strong>Desertification</strong>
            What is serious, really, is the indiscriminate or uncontrolled logging, apart from the arson, since without subsequent reforestation and without proper forest management, this area will become a desertified area.</li>
        <li><strong> Of habitat, biodiversity and soil</strong>
            Deforestation leads to damage to ecosystems, a loss of biodiversity and aridity in the terrain. In addition, the fixation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is avoided, thus contributing to climate change. Deforested regions tend to soil erosion and eventually become unproductive land. What leads to no type of vegetation growing, not serving as a food and shelter area for animals or for us to grow food.</li>
        
           <li><strong> Of large forest masses</strong>
            Some places that suffer from this problem seriously, since one part is controlled but another very large one is not, are areas of Latin America, rich in forests and jungles, such as the Amazon area. In this other article we show you the Deforestation of the Amazon, its causes and consequences. Likewise, deforestation in Mexico, Argentina, Colombia and Peru is very significant, since in several areas of these places there is massive logging for various reasons.</li>
        <li><strong>Global weather modification</strong> 
            When forests and jungles are lost, as we have indicated, the water cycle and temperatures in the region and also globally are modified. Therefore, more actions are added that accelerate global warming and climate change.</li>
        <h1>3. How to avoid deforestation</h1>
            <li>Apart from knowing the causes of the felling of trees and the possible consequences of this, it is necessary to think about solutions to deforestation and ways to avoid it. The first big step to avoid deforestation, as in any area of ​​vital importance for the planet, is to reach a great global agreement between the governments of the whole world. Preventive and also remedial measures of the problem must be established. But in the personal sphere certain actions can also be carried out. Personal responsibility cannot be evaded in this problem. Certain gestures, no matter how insignificant they may seem, can help to tackle the problem. For example, paper recycling. A lower consumption of paper by the population would force the producing companies to not need so much raw material.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainable forest management certificates</strong>
            On the other hand, it is essential to keep forests and green areas clean. In this way, fires caused by glass, soft drink cans and other types of waste are prevented. Finally, it is necessary to keep informed about the bad practices that companies carry out to boycott, if it is the case, their products. Large areas of forests and jungles depend on responsible consumption. Greenpeace and other environmental organizations publish reports on the matter. In addition, consuming certified sustainable forest management products (such as those promoted by FSC or PEFC) helps keep forests in good condition.</li>
