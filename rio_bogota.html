           <h1>bogotá river consequence</h1>
            <p>This tributary daily receives approximately 800 tons of industrial, solid and biological waste. This contamination has generated an environmental impact and a public health problem due to the different toxins that are concentrated there, such as cadmium, chromium, mercury, zinc, arsenic and lead.</p>

        <h1>Consequences</h1>
        
        <li>The river represents a risk of cancer for the population due to heavy metal poisoning or respiratory diseases because the pollution destroys viruses and bacteria, affecting the skin and the gastrointestinal system.</li>
        <li>Water pollution impoverishes aquatic ecosystems and facilitates the uncontrolled proliferation of phytoplanktonic algae in lakes —eutrophication</li>
        <li>These contaminants can change the color, taste, temperature and smell of the water, affecting organisms that live in it or losing its quality for human consumption. Chemical pollution are substances dissolved in water such as: detergents, acids, fertilizers, dyes, etc.</li>
        <h1>Causes of the contamination of the Bogota river</h1>
        <li>Industries, extractive mining and debris. The three discharges from Bogotá that affect the river, leaving it anoxic and lifeless are Salitre, Fucha and Tunjuelo.</li>
        <li>The main contaminants in water include bacteria, viruses, parasites, fertilizers, pesticides, drugs, nitrates, phosphates, plastics, fecal waste, and even radioactive substances. These elements do not always stain the water, making water pollution invisible on many occasions.</li>
        <li>80% of pollutants in Colombia are caused by automobiles, the rest by industries and residences, and nearly 8,000 people die year after year due to air pollution.</li>
        
        <h1>Institutional actions to decontaminate the Bogotá River</h1>
        
        <li>One of the actions adopted by the authorities was the creation of WWTP Wastewater Treatment Plants operated by the CAR Regional Autonomous Corporations. These plants have the function of filtering, clarifying and, in general, treating the sewage water that will later reach the Bogotá River.Currently, there are 30 WWTPs, of which 6 are in the optimization process (Sopó, Zipaquirá, Cajicá, Chocontá, Suesca and Sesquilé). In addition, the procedures for the execution of 5 more WWTPs (Ricaurte, Cota, Villapinzón, Tausa and Canoas) are already being carried out.</li>
        
        <h1>How to contribute to the recovery of the Bogotá River?</h1>
        
        <li>The citizens of Bogota, Cundinamarca and visitors can support the recovery of the river with simple actions on a day-to-day basis to prevent the most polluting waste from reaching the river:</li>
        
        <li>Do not pour oils into the kitchen siphon.</li>
        <li>Do not dispose of toilet paper, tampons or condoms in the toilet.</li>
        <li>Do not throw cigarette butts in the streets.</li>
        <li>Dispose of solid waste only in garbage cans.</li>
        <li>When shaving, do not throw the waste down the drain.</li>
        
        <h1>Why is it important to decontaminate the Bogotá River?</h1>
        <li>This flow has a great environmental, social and economic impact for the entire Cundinamarca and Bogotá region, so maintaining the levels of contamination that are present today would have several implications:
        
            Reduction of the national GDP, since the river contributes about 32% of the national Gross Domestic Product and influences the lives of more than 9 million people, according to the Bogotá Government Secretariat.
            
            Difficulty for the development of the economy in the region taking into account that 26% of agricultural, livestock and industrial activities take place on the ring road and areas surrounding the river.
            
            Eventual public health problem due to bad odors and poor water quality as a result of the decomposition of human waste that reaches the tributary.
            
            Extinction of the fauna and flora in the area due to the poor conditions for the survival of native species and the low presence of dissolved oxygen in the water.</li>
        
        
        
        
        
        </ul>
