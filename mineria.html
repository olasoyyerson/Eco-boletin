               <h1>Illegal minery</h1>
                <p>65% of the gold mines in Colombia are illegal. The environmental footprint is calculated in the degradation of more than 100,000 hectares. Mongabay Latam spoke with experts to find out their opinion of Petro's decisions against illegal mining and how much they can improve the problem.</p>

<h1>1.Main consequences of illegal mining and damage to the environment</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong> geologically:</strong>Due to the removal of the superficial layers of the land, the instability of the land is produced and when the rock formations are exposed, erosion occurs, which is the main cause of landslides. Likewise, due to the indiscriminate use of dynamite, the processes of separation of rocks and faults in the land are accelerated, leaving geomorphological and topographic changes as consequences.</li>
<li><strong></strong></li>






<li><strong>biologically</strong>The main impact is on natural forests, moors and water tributaries that, when contaminated, cause the loss of resources, species and animals in danger of extinction.

    Faced with the water resource, the so-called open-pit mining increases the content of the sediments and causes diversion of the riverbeds, this generates transformation of the landscape, floods and loss of crops. In addition, the use of chemicals and heavy metals causes contamination of bodies of water due to dumping of solid, domestic and industrial waste, especially related to mining activity.</li>
<li><strong>Socially</strong>en las zonas sometidas a explotación minera, por lo general, existe un aumento desmedido de los servicios públicos, se genera violencia, pérdida de cultura, migraciones masivas de población, desigualdad social, cambio de actividades económicas y sociales, crecimiento de la miseria para las familias que tienen su sustento de la actividad agrícola y sobre todo las tierras se vuelven improductivas trayendo como consecuencia su abandono.

    La construcción de oleoductos, de vías mal planificadas, de trochas o caminos de herradura para sacar y comercializar el producto minero explotado produce alteración de la fauna, la flora y los suelos, en todos los ecosistemas por lo que necesariamente tienen que pasar; se presenta contaminación por derrames de químicos o de productos minerales, la proliferación de accidentes causados por descuido o la mayoría de los casos intencionalmente. Aunado a lo anterior se produce contaminación visual o gaseosa por emisiones o escape del polvillo como es el caso del carbón, que es transportado desde las zonas de producción hasta los puertos de exportación, y que se realiza vía férrea, marítima o terrestre.</li>

<h1>2.How can we combat illegal mining?</h1>
<li>The governments of various Latin American countries such as Brazil, Colombia or Peru; have implemented different regulations to combat illegal mining. For example, all heavy machinery must have a global positioning system (GPS) in order to authorize its movement within the territories. Satellite tracking devices have become security and prevention allies against irregular activities such as illegal mining.

    Satellite equipment facilitates the work of monitoring and controlling machinery, not only for businessmen, but also for law enforcement, as they provide the exact location of the purchased equipment and even if it is outside cellular coverage areas. In this way, it can be determined when the machinery follows the route assigned by the manager or has deviated from it. Today, these satellite equipment are a great tool to help prevent the illegal extraction of minerals, thanks to the asset tracking function that allows you to control and know the exact position of the machinery every so often. Today the benefits are many and at affordable prices.

    Some equipment suggested for this industry are the SmartOne Solar or the SmartOne C, whose movement sensors allow the monitoring of the route traveled by the machinery in real time and the control of the operating hours of the machinery in time intervals; which facilitates the monitoring of the operation of heavy equipment. They also maintain and sustain operational efficiency while strengthening and automating internal processes for continued business growth.
    
    In addition to the mapping and monitoring benefits provided by the SPOT My Globalstar platform, we provide greater visibility for the business by allowing live and historical tracking. In addition to receiving alerts and shared views, also generating reports that provide valuable data and opportunities to make informed decisions that can save time, money and lives. This is all thanks to Globalstar's commercial IoT satellite solutions that enable operational efficiencies while strengthening and automating internal processes for continued business growth.</li>

<h1>3.Main resources extracted from illegal mining in Colombia</h1>
<li><strong>Gold</strong>Gold is one of the most coveted resources in illegal mining in Colombia. Illegal miners often extract gold from rivers and jungle areas, causing serious environmental damage.</li>

<li><strong>Coal</strong>Illegal coal mining is another significant problem in Colombia. Criminal groups often engage in unauthorized mining of coal in abandoned mines or protected areas.</li>


<li><strong>emeralds</strong>Colombia is known for its high-quality emeralds, and the illegal mining of these gemstones is a common problem in the country.</li>
<li><strong>Coltan</strong>El coltan es un mineral que se utiliza en la fabricación de dispositivos electrónicos, y la extracción ilegal de coltan ha sido un problema en algunas áreas de Colombia.    </li>
<li><strong>diamonds</strong>Although not as common as gold or coal, illegal diamond mining also occurs in Colombia.</li>
<h1>4.Regions most affected by illegal mining</h1>
<li><strong>Antioquia Department: </strong>Antioquia, in northwestern Colombia, is one of the regions most affected by illegal gold mining. The illegal exploitation of gold in rivers and jungle areas is a serious problem in this region.</li>
<li><strong>Chocó Department: </strong>Chocó, located on the Pacific coast of Colombia, is another epicenter of illegal mining. The illegal extraction of gold and other minerals has caused significant environmental damage in this area.</li>
<li><strong>Bolívar Department:</strong>In Bolívar, resources such as gold and coal are illegally extracted, and illegal mining has contributed to local conflicts and environmental problems.</li>
<li><strong>Cauca Department:</strong>Illegal mining of gold and other minerals is a problem in Cauca, in southwestern Colombia. The presence of illegal armed groups has further complicated the situation.</li>
<li><strong>Nariño Department:</strong>Nariño, in southwestern Colombia, also faces significant illegal mining problems, including the extraction of gold and other minerals.</li>
<li><strong>Department of Guainía and Vaupés:</strong>In the Amazonian regions of Guainía and Vaupés, illegal mining has caused environmental damage in one of the most biodiverse areas of the country.</li>
